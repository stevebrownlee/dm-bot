background: "Aldric showed magical aptitude at a young age, accidentally levitating objects when emotional. He was apprenticed to the renowned wizard Mordenkaine at age 16. For eight years he studied under the master, learning the fundamental arts of magic. When Mordenkaine disappeared during an expedition to the Shadowfell, Aldric inherited his master's tower (and debts). Now he adventures to gather knowledge, gold, and clues about his master's fate while honing his arcane powers."

notes: "Aldric's Sleep spell is devastatingly effective at level 1, capable of instantly incapacitating groups of weak enemies (goblins, kobolds, 1 HD creatures). He stays behind the party's front line, conserving his single spell for critical moments. His Intelligence of 17 gives him an 85% chance to learn new spells he encounters. He is always seeking new spells for his spellbook and magical knowledge. His low HP makes him extremely vulnerable in melee combat."
