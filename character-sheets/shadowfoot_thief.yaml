background: "Shadowfoot grew up on the streets of a large human city, orphaned young and forced to survive by his wits. He learned the art of thievery from necessity, becoming skilled at picking pockets and locks. Despite his profession, he has a code of honor - he steals from the wealthy and corrupt, never from the poor. He was caught once, and would have hanged if not for a kind merchant who spoke for him. Now he adventures to repay that debt, using his skills to help those who cannot help themselves. He dreams of one day establishing a safe haven for halfling refugees and orphans."

notes: "Shadowfoot excels at scouting and disabling traps. His backstab ability makes him deadly when surprising foes. His high Dex gives him excellent AC for a first-level character. The halfling bonuses to stealth make him ideal for sneaking ahead of the party. His climb walls ability (92%) means he can scale most surfaces reliably. He's most vulnerable in direct combat and relies on hiding, surprise attacks, and clever tactics rather than toe-to-toe fighting."
