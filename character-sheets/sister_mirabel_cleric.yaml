background: "Mirabel was orphaned young and raised in the Temple of the Dawn. She showed early aptitude for healing and devotion, taking her holy orders at age 20. For eight years she served in the temple, tending to the sick and learning the ways of combat to defend those who cannot defend themselves. Now she ventures forth to bring the light of her faith to dark places, heal the afflicted, and smite the undead who desecrate the natural order."

notes: "Sister Mirabel's turning undead ability is her greatest asset in dangerous dungeons. She typically prepares Cure Light Wounds as her spell, ready to heal wounded companions. She believes in giving enemies a chance to surrender, but shows no mercy to undead abominations. Her mace is her primary weapon, blessed by her temple's high priest."
